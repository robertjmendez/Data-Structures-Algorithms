//       Problem:
//Given a linked list, write a function to reverse the nodes of the list in-place.
//Example:
//Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
//Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
//Note:
//A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
//Return a deep copy of the list.
